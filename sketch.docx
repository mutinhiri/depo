TASK B VALIDATION AND UNIT TESTING
- The model is the gatekeeper between the world of code and the database
validation is for protecting the database to avoid bad data
validation checks one or more fields against one or more conditions 

presense: true checks if name fields is present
uniqueness: true checks to make sure if username is not replicated

Each fixture contains data for a single model. The name of the fixture is significant: the base name of the file must match the name odf the database table
